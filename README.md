# DoubleSlitSim
Simulation of double slit experiment

## Basic plan for our simulation:

- Define Parameters: Such as wavelength of light, distance between the slits, distance to the screen, and slit width.
- Compute Wave Amplitude: Using the Fraunhofer diffraction equation for each slit and sum the amplitudes for interference.
- Calculate Intensity: Intensity of light is proportional to the square of the amplitude.
- Visualize: Plot the resulting interference pattern.
